# highlight-tabs
firefox addon to highlight tabs with colors for easy and fast recognition and fluid workflow

with this addon you can highlight your important tabs in different colors , 

so after session restore and with tons of tabs open you can easily find those 3 important tabs etc.

--------------------------

- use the tab context menu with various colors , or quickly alt click a tab to color/uncolor it 

- supports multitabs selection 

--------------------------

this is part of my "tab-trio" collection which i need for quick and efficient work/research in firefox (but works with standard tabs too).


tested on firefox 100
